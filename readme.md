# RISAD Project
##### Router Intelligent Search And Destroy Platform


Nothing fancy about this project of mine, just a little curiousity game i'm playing.

### Objectives
- Create a program that can scan through IP range for available http services (Usually people leave the remote management of their routers open, so I'm going to search for those routers.)
- Make an ajax request to that router and get the HTML string.
- Search for router branding patterns in the string (ISPs usually put branding patterns in their routers, we need to look for those patterns.)
- If a pattern is found, report back.

### Requirements to run.
- NodeJS
- Knowledge of Javascript
- and a brain.

### Deployment
- clone this repo
- install nodejs and npm
- execute "npm install" in the terminal/command line
- review the code and make changes (the start variable)
- run through nodejs

### Todo
- nodejs console input
- add more pattern (currently it recognized only 1 pattern)

### Note: Explore the world and keep Hacking!
